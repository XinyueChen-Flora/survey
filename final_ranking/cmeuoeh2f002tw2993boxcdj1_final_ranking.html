<h2><strong>Top Distribution Channels to Maximize Reach</strong></h2>
<p>Leverage a three-pronged Owned / Earned / Paid approach:</p>
<p><strong>Owned Channels:</strong>

<p><strong>Earned / Partnership:</strong>
- Press Outreach — tech media (TechCrunch, The Verge), design/marketing publications<br />
- Influencer Collabs — partner with content creators on YouTube/TikTok to produce tutorials/reactions<br />
- Community Engagement — Canva Creators Program, Reddit AMA in design/video editing subreddits</p>
<p><strong>Paid Channels:</strong>
- Google Search Ads targeting high-intent keywords (e.g., “online AI video editor”)<br />
- Paid Social — Meta/Instagram/TikTok ads using captivating video snippets made in the editor<br />
- LinkedIn Sponsored Posts for B2B targeting (marketing, comms, edu, startup sectors)<br />
- Native Ads in creative/tech industry newsletters</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Pro tip for amplification:</strong><br />
Pair <strong>data-backed headlines</strong> (“AI Video Market to Hit $2B by 2030 — Here’s How Canva Is Leading the Charge”) with <strong>visual-first content snippets</strong> from the AI Video Editor to tease the tool’s capabilities. This lends both authority and shareability.</p>

                        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Launch goal: Announce Slack’s new AI Meeting Summarizer to position Slack as the most practical, secure way to turn meetings into actionable work—inside the place teams already collaborate—driving adoption and shifting perception from chat to AI-powered work platform.</li>
<li>Launch thesis: The workplace is moving from meetings to artifacts. Ambient AI embedded in workflows—not standalone apps—will win on adoption, ROI, and trust. Slack’s Meeting Summarizer operationalizes this shift by transforming spoken collaboration into shared, auditable, and actionable outcomes in Slack.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Trends in Workplace AI to Frame the Launch</h2>
<p>1) From meetings to artifacts

                        <p>Here’s a high-level snapshot of the workplace AI landscape to frame Slack’s AI Meeting Summarizer announcement:</p>
<h2>1) Strong, Sustained Growth Outlook</h2>
<ul>
<li>Accelerating enterprise GenAI adoption: Analyst outlooks indicate rapid spending growth on GenAI solutions through 2027+, with most large organizations piloting or deploying GenAI-powered assistants embedded in daily tools.</li>
<li>Collaboration suites are the tip of the spear: Productivity platforms (Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Zoom, Slack) are converging on AI copilots that summarize meetings, generate recaps, and surface action items—driving mainstream exposure and normalized usage.</li>
<li>Speech/voice tech maturity: Ongoing improvements in speech recognition, diarization, and language models underpin higher-fidelity meeting transcripts—enabling more precise summaries and action extraction across accents, domains, and environments.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2) Key Adoption Drivers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Meeting overload and time scarcity: Hybrid/remote work expanded the number and length of meetings; teams need fast, reliable ways to catch up asynchronously without replaying recordings.</li>
<li>Shift to async collaboration: Summaries, decisions, and action items need to be consumable in channels/threads where teams already coordinate—reducing reliance on synchronous attendance.</li>
<li>Actionability &gt; archives: Users want more than notes; they need well-structured outcomes (owners, deadlines, decisions) that feed tasks, tickets, and follow-ups automatically.</li>
<li>Trust, privacy, and compliance: Enterprise buyers require clear data boundaries, admin controls, region-specific data handling, and auditability—especially under emerging regulations (e.g., EU AI Act).</li>
<li>Multilingual, accessible work: Global teams need language support, translation, and accessibility features (captions, speaker attribution) to keep work inclusive and searchable.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3) Notable Workplace AI Trends (2024–2030)</h2>
<ul>
<li>From “generic recap” to “context-aware intelligence”: Best-in-class tools enrich meeting summaries with relevant channel history, documents, and recent decisions, producing concise, useful recaps that reflect the project’s reality—not just the last 30 minutes of audio.</li>
<li>Outcome-first summaries: AI outputs will standardize key fields—goals discussed, decisions made, risks/blocks, owners, due dates—and auto-publish them to the right channels, tasks, and calendars.</li>
<li>Human-in-the-loop by default: Practical controls—approve/edit before posting, request clarifications, tag owners—build trust and increase adoption; teams prefer steerable AI, not black-box recaps.</li>
<li>Multi-modal capture: Summarizers incorporate slides, shared docs, whiteboards, and chat alongside audio/video; visual artifacts get referenced in-line, boosting clarity.</li>
<li>Governance and data controls: IT needs granular admin policies (which meetings can be summarized, retention windows, who can view, consent workflows, regional processing). “Enterprise-grade” will be a purchasing filter.</li>
<li>Cross-tool interoperability: Buyers want summarization that works across Zoom, Google Meet, Teams, and recorded huddles—and lands results where teams execute (Slack channels, project tools, CRM, ticketing).</li>
<li>Measurable ROI: Teams will expect tangible outcomes—reduced meeting time, faster onboarding, higher action completion rates, lower duplication—and will use these metrics to justify renewals/expansion.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4) Competitive Landscape (What Users See Today)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Copilot for Teams: Meeting Recap, speaker timelines, AI notes, follow-ups tied to M365 apps; strong if fully standardized on Microsoft, but less flexible across non-Microsoft workflows.</li>
<li>Google Meet + Gemini for Workspace: Auto summaries, action suggestions within Google ecosystem; favors organizations heavily invested in Workspace.</li>
<li>Zoom AI Companion: Live note-taking, summaries, and next steps integrated in Zoom; best for Zoom-first environments but requires downstream workflow integrations.</li>
<li>Specialized meeting intelligence (Otter.ai, Fireflies.ai, Avoma, Fathom, Supernormal): Strong transcription and recap features with conversation intelligence; often require manual export/posting and may sit outside team hubs where actions happen.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Strategic Implications for Slack’s AI Meeting Summarizer Launch</h2>
<ul>
<li>Frame it as “From meetings to outcomes—in the flow of work”: Slack can uniquely deliver summaries where coordination already happens (channels/DMs), turning recaps into immediate, visible team action.</li>
<li>Differentiate on context-awareness: Position summaries that incorporate relevant channel history, linked docs, and prior decisions to produce higher-signal outputs vs. generic note dumps.</li>
<li>Emphasize actionability and automation: Auto-extract decisions, owners, and due dates; one-click convert to tasks/tickets (e.g., Jira, Asana, ServiceNow), schedule follow-ups, or trigger Slack workflows—moving beyond passive summaries.</li>
<li>Lead with enterprise trust: Highlight Slack’s security posture, data isolation, admin controls, retention, consent, data residency options, and compliance alignment—clear advantages for regulated industries.</li>
<li>Open by design: Work across the tools customers already use (Zoom, Google Meet, Teams recordings) and post structured outputs consistently in Slack—reducing vendor lock-in concerns.</li>
<li>Target high-velocity adopters:</li>
<li>Sales and Customer Success: Auto-post call recaps to deal channels, route next steps to CRM/tasks.</li>
<li>Product and Engineering: Summarize standups/reviews, capture decisions, log action items to issue trackers.</li>
<li>Recruiting and HR: Summarize interviews and hiring debriefs, standardize feedback, track next steps.</li>
<li>Support and Services: Turn customer escalations into actionable tasks with owner/due date directly in Slack.</li>
<li>Proof themes for announcement:</li>
<li>Speed to clarity: Catch up on any meeting in under a minute.</li>
<li>Better than attendance: Async participation without missing context.</li>
<li>Measurable impact: Fewer duplicative meetings, faster decision-making, higher action completion rates.</li>
<li>Built for IT: Configurable policies, scoped access, and auditability from day one.</li>
</ul>

                        <h1>Title: Introducing Slack’s AI Meeting Summarizer: Turn Every Meeting Into Outcomes</h1>
<p>If your calendar is packed and your channels are busier than ever, you’re not alone. Hybrid work has expanded collaboration across time zones and teams—but it’s also expanded the number of meetings we’re all expected to join. Many of us are juggling live sessions, notes apps, shared docs, and follow-up messages just to keep momentum. It’s time for a simpler path from discussion to decision to done.</p>
<p>Today, we’re introducing Slack’s AI Meeting Summarizer to help every team turn meetings into outcomes—right where work happens. Instead of toggling between tools or digging through long transcripts, you’ll get focused summaries with decisions, owners, and next steps delivered to the right channel or canvas. Catch up in minutes, stay aligned asynchronously, and keep work moving with less overhead.</p>
<h2>Why now: AI belongs in the flow of work</h2>
<p>Over the past year, AI has moved from novelty to necessity inside the tools we use every day. Colleagues expect relevant answers in seconds, concise recaps after discussions, and help turning ideas into next steps. That shift is especially urgent for meetings. Not everyone can attend live; conversations are rich but fleeting; and the real value comes from what happens after the meeting ends.</p>
<p>Slack is where teams coordinate, align, and execute. With AI Meeting Summarizer, the outcomes of a discussion—decisions, owners, timelines—live alongside the work itself. That’s the difference between notes that get filed away and outcomes that drive momentum.</p>
<h2>How Slack’s AI Meeting Summarizer works</h2>
<ul>
<li>Summarize across platforms: Whether you’re in a Slack huddle or using a supported external meeting tool, Slack can generate a meeting summary that captures the heart of the conversation.</li>
<li>Deliver recaps where they belong: Summaries post to the appropriate channel or canvas, so the right people can review, discuss, and keep things moving.</li>
<li>Turn talk into tasks: Decisions and action items are highlighted with owners and due dates. Teams can track them via Slack lists/workflows and get reminders automatically.</li>
<li>Keep knowledge discoverable: Summaries become part of your channel’s history. Use Slack AI to search for decisions, action items, and context later—no need to replay or rehash.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Meet less. Catch up faster. Execute more.</h2>
<p>When outcomes are accessible in Slack, you don’t need everyone in the room to make progress. Smaller, focused meetings become the norm. Teammates who couldn’t attend can catch up in minutes with the recap and ask clarifying questions right in the channel. That means fewer status meetings, faster alignment, and more time for deep work.</p>
<h2>Built for enterprise trust</h2>
<p>Deploying AI at scale requires more than a clever feature. It requires trust. Slack’s AI Meeting Summarizer is built with enterprise-grade security and admin transparency in mind, aligning with the controls and governance options organizations rely on. Admins can configure access, retention, and sharing to match company policies. The result: Teams move faster without compromising on the standards that keep their data safe.</p>
<h2>Designed to work across your tools</h2>
<p>Your meetings don’t all happen in one place—and that’s okay. Slack’s AI Meeting Summarizer is designed to work across huddles and supported external meeting platforms. No matter where the conversation happens, the outcomes land in Slack, where cross-functional work continues.</p>
<h2>How teams are using it today</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sales and Customer Success: After a customer call, the summary posts to the account channel with next steps and owners. Hand off seamlessly to solutions or support, and keep stakeholders in the loop via Slack Connect.</li>
<li>Product and Engineering: Sprint reviews and incident calls automatically produce structured outcomes with timelines and DRI assignments—easy to reference in future retros.</li>
<li>Marketing and Comms: Campaign reviews result in clear approvals, feedback, and deadlines, posted in the campaign channel so global teams can move forward asynchronously.</li>
<li>Support and Operations: Postmortems produce consistent, searchable summaries and action lists that improve future response and reliability.</li>
<li>HR and Recruiting: Interview debriefs generate standardized recaps and action items for hiring teams to review and track.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How we compare</h2>
<p>Standalone note-taking tools have improved transcription and summaries, but they often leave actions stranded outside the team’s daily workflow. Platform-specific AI can deliver strong recaps inside a single meeting tool, yet outcomes can get siloed if your teams collaborate primarily in Slack. Slack’s AI Meeting Summarizer brings the best of both worlds: flexibility across meeting platforms with outcomes that live where your teams plan, discuss, and execute.</p>
<h2>A smarter way to work, together</h2>
<p>Meetings aren’t going away—but with the right AI in the right place, they can become lighter, clearer, and more effective. Slack’s AI Meeting Summarizer helps you focus on what matters: decisions made, actions owned, and progress measured. So you can meet less, catch up faster, and keep work moving—together.</p>
